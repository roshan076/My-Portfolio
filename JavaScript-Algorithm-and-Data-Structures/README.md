## Projects

### 1. Pyramid Generator
The [`Pyramid Generator`](./01.Pyramid-Generator/script.js) project generates a star pyramid pattern where the rows can either be in normal or inverted order, depending on the inverted flag. Each row is padded with spaces for proper alignment, creating a symmetric pattern of stars.

## Acknowledgments
- These projects were completed as guided exercises provided by freeCodeCamp.
- Project Guidance: [freeCodeCamp Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/)

## How to View
To execute the project, run the `script.js` file in a JavaScript runtime environment.
