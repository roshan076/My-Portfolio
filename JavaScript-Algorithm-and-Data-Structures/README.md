## Projects

### 1. Pyramid Generator
The [`Pyramid Generator`](./01.Pyramid-Generator/script.js) project generates a star pyramid pattern where the rows can either be in normal or inverted order, depending on the inverted flag. Each row is padded with spaces for proper alignment, creating a symmetric pattern of stars.

### 2. Gradebook
The [`Gradebook`](./02.Gradebook/script.js) project calculates a student's grade based on a list of scores. It provides the class average and the student's grade while determining if the student has passed or failed the course. The grading system ranges from A++ to F, with a passing grade being D or higher.

## Acknowledgments
- These projects were completed as guided exercises provided by freeCodeCamp.

## How to View
To execute the project, run the `script.js` file in a JavaScript runtime environment.
