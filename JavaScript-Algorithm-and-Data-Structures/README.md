## Projects

### 1. Pyramid Generator
The [`Pyramid Generator`](./01.Pyramid-Generator/script.js) project generates a star pyramid pattern where the rows can either be in normal or inverted order, depending on the inverted flag. Each row is padded with spaces for proper alignment, creating a symmetric pattern of stars.

### 2. Gradebook
The [`Gradebook`](./02.Gradebook/script.js) project calculates a student's grade based on a list of scores. It provides the class average and the student's grade while determining if the student has passed or failed the course. The grading system ranges from A++ to F, with a passing grade being D or higher.

### 3. RPG - Dragon Repeller
The [`RPG - Dragon Repeller`](./03.RPG-Dragon-Repeller/index.html) project is an interactive RPG game where the player must defeat various monsters, including a dragon, to save the town. Players can explore different locations such as the town square, store, and cave, while upgrading their weapons and health. The game features turn-based combat mechanics with random events like weapon breaking and an Easter egg mini-game.

### 4. Color Changer
The [`Color Changer`](04.Color-Changer/index.html) project allows users to change the background to a random dark color with a button click. The current background hex code is displayed and updates with each color change.

### 5. Calorie Counter
The [`Calorie Counter`](05.Calorie-Counter/index.html) project helps users track their daily calorie consumption and expenditure. Users can input their calorie budget and add food or exercise entries under different categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and exercise. The tools displays the total calories consumed and burned for the day.

### 6. RPS Game
The [`RPS Game`](./06.RPS-Game/index.html) project simulates the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The player competes against the computer, choosing between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game is won by the first to reach three points, with rules stating that Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.

### 7. Music Player
The [`Music Player`](./07.Music-Player/index.html) project is a simple music player app that utilizes basic string and array methods to manage song data, display album art, and provide playback controls. Users can play, pause, and navigate through songs while enjoying a visually appealing interface.

### 8. Date Formatter
The [`Date Formatter`](./08.Date-Formatter/index.html) project is a simple web-based date formatter that displays the current date in different formats based on the selected dropdown option. Users can switch between various date formats, including day-month-year, year-month-day, and month-day-year with time.

### 9. Football Team Cards
The [`Football Team Cards`](./09.Football-Team-Cards/index.html) project displays details about Argentina's 1986 World Cup-winning football team, including player cards that feature their names, positions, numbers, and nicknames. Users can filter players based on their roles or nicknames using a dropdown menu.
