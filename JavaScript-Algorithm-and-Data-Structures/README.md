## Projects

### 1. Pyramid Generator
The [`Pyramid Generator`](./01.Pyramid-Generator/script.js) project generates a star pyramid pattern where the rows can either be in normal or inverted order, depending on the inverted flag. Each row is padded with spaces for proper alignment, creating a symmetric pattern of stars.

### 2. Gradebook
The [`Gradebook`](./02.Gradebook/script.js) project calculates a student's grade based on a list of scores. It provides the class average and the student's grade while determining if the student has passed or failed the course. The grading system ranges from A++ to F, with a passing grade being D or higher.

### 3. RPG - Dragon Repeller
The [`RPG - Dragon Repeller`](./03.RPG-Dragon-Repeller/index.html) project is an interactive RPG game where the player must defeat various monsters, including a dragon, to save the town. Players can explore different locations such as the town square, store, and cave, while upgrading their weapons and health. The game features turn-based combat mechanics with random events like weapon breaking and an Easter egg mini-game.
